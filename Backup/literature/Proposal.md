# Learning Universal Vector Representations for Objects of Different 3D Euclidean Formats

In recent years, neural networks have been proved to be one of the most powerful learning algorithms for computer vision tasks, especially on 2D Euclidean data. The learned feature vectors have been used for object classification, image reconstruction or segmentation tasks. Later on, similar methods have been proposed on 3D Euclidean data. 

We study the problem of 3D object reconstruction,
