`.binvox` files:

`.mat` files

`.obj` file (Wavefront):

The OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone.



## 3D Dataset

### [ShapeNet](https://www.shapenet.org/)

**ShapeNetCore:** A densely annotated **subset of ShapeNet** covering 55 common object categories with ~51,300 unique 3D models.

fotmat:  .obj + .mtl +



**ShapeNetCore v1 (July 2015):**

*note:* some models are mirrored and have incorrect normals.

data format: .obj + .mtl



**ShapeNetCore v2 (Fall 2016):** An update to ShapeNetCore with improved quality of model geometry and fixed issues relating to materials and textures.

data format:  .obj + .mtl  + .binvox



Introduction of `.binvox` format: https://www.patrickmin.com/binvox/

There is the script which transforms `.obj`  to `.binvox`.
