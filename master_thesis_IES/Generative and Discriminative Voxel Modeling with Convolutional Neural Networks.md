## Generative and Discriminative Voxel Modeling with Convolutional Neural Networks

### Abstract



### Research Objective

* 3D object modeling based on **voxel data** representation

### Background and Problems

* point cloud, mesh are not guaranteed to be arrange in a regular grid

  unsuitable for CNNs

* shallow 3D ConvNets are not in the best performance

### Approach

* Voxel-based VAE: 2.1 technical details
* key modification to loss function to improve traning
* Voxel-based ConvNets
  * 

### Evaluation



### Conclusion



### Notes



#### New Unknown Concepts

- [ ] KL divergence prior
- [ ] Nesterov momentum
- [ ] Inception-style module
