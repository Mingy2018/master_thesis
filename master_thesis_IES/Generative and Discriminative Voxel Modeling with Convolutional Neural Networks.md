## Generative and Discriminative Voxel Modeling with Convolutional Neural Networks - Aug 2016

### Abstract

The paper explores the representation of voxel data, learning the latent space by the autoencoder can help in shape modeling and object classification. The unique representations help the classification problem with relative 50% improvement.

### Research Objective

* 3D object modeling based on **voxel data** representation(latent space)

### Background and Problems

* point cloud, mesh are not guaranteed to be arrange in a regular grid

  unsuitable for CNNs

* shallow 3D ConvNets are not in the best performance

### Approach

* Voxel-based VAE: 2.1 technical details
* key modification to loss function to improve training
* Voxel-based ConvNets
  * 

### Evaluation



### Conclusion



### Notes



#### New Unknown Concepts

- [ ] KL divergence prior
- [ ] Nesterov momentum
- [ ] Inception-style module
