## Learning a Probabilistic Latent of Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling

### Abstract

### Research Objective

varied and realistic 3D modeling

### Background and Problems

* traditional 3D modeling: synthesis of existing parts from database, not conceptual novel
* many deep learning networks for 3D data is supervised
* GANs are previously used to generate 2D images

### Method

* 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN)
  * adaptive training strategy: update the discriminator selectively ->
    make training stable and produce better results
* 3D VAE GAN
  * 

### Evaluation



### Conclusion



### Notes



#### New Unknown Concepts

- [ ] traditional heuristic criteria
- [ ] binary cross entropy
- [ ]
